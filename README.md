This repo contains some code about experiments for Fiedler Regularization

The main.py file contains the main execution loop

The core object is the experiment, which takes in the dataset and the regularization type that you want to use

The experiment will then fetch the dataset, hyperparameters, model, as well as train and evaluate the model, and log the results. 

All file names or function names should be pretty self explanatory.
